# Total RP 3: RP Name in Roll

## About

**Total RP 3: RP Name in Roll** is an *unofficial module* for [Total RP 3](https://github.com/Total-RP-3/Total-RP-3), designed to enhance immersion by replacing out-of-character (OOC) names in `/roll` messages with the character's in-character (IC) roleplay name and profile color. This makes roll outcomes easier to read and better integrated into the roleplay context.

## Features

This addon hooks into the `/roll` system and:

- Detects roll messages (e.g. `Zinneith rolls 42 (1-100)`) in chat.
- Matches the name in the message with the unit in your group or raid.
- Queries Total RP 3 for the IC name from the unitâ€™s currently active profile.
- Replaces the original OOC name with the IC name.
- Applies the character's TRP3 display color to the name for added readability and immersion.
